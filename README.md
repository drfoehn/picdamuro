Drawing-Charade with your own word selection incl. CSS-dice
The idea was to have something at hand for the kids to play.

This is a JS Version of the Charade-Game using only drawing.
You can customize the words by altering the JSON-File. (I recommend letting Gemini or other AIs produce some subjects and verbs)
Currently the file consits only of German words, but you can edit as you please.

There is also a CSS dice which shows up after you have guessed the word.

## How to play:
* Make a boardgame with alternating fields of blue, red and yellow (or use mine: see picdamuro.pdf in the files)
* Depending on the color of the field you are standing on, choose "Verb" (red), "Subject" (blue) or "Egal" (yellow) and click "Neues Wort"
* Once you are ready click "Start" (The word itself will disappear so the other team can check the clock).
* If the time is up the screen turns red and the word will automatically reappear.
* If you guessed the word correctly press stop (The word will reappear for the other team to check including a CSS dice to toss)
* Toss the dice by clicking on it and move on the board accordingly.

You can also press pause in case you need to go to the toilet in the meantime :)

Have fun!
