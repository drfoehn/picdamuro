# picdamuro
Pictionary with your own word selection incl. dice


This is a JS Version of the Charade-Game.
You can customize the words by altering the JSON-File.
Currently the file consits only of german words, but you can edit as you please.

There is als a CSS dice you can use.

## How to play:
* Make a boardgame (or download mine: picdamuro.pdf)
* Depending on the color of the field you are standing on, choose Verb or Subject and click "New word"
* Once you are ready click "Start" (The word itself will disappear so the other team can check the clock.
* If the time is up the word will automatically reappear.
* If you guessed the word correctly press stop (The word will reappear for the other team to check)
* Toss the dice by clicking on it and move on the board accordingly.

You can also press pause in case you need to go to the toilet in the meantime :)

Have fun!
