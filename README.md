# picdamuro
Drawing-Charade with your own word selection incl. CSS-dice
The idea was to have something at hand for the kids to play.

This is a JS Version of the Charade-Game using only drawing.
You can customize the words by altering the JSON-File. (I recommend letting Gemini or other AIs produce some subjects and verbs)
Currently the file consits only of German words, but you can edit as you please.

There is also a CSS dice which shows up after you have guessed the word.

## How to play:
* Make a boardgame with alternating fields of blue, red and yellow (or use mine: see Spielplan_Picdamuro.pdf in the files)
* The games rules are available on the index.html (in German)

You can also press pause in case you need to go to the toilet in the meantime :)

Have fun!
